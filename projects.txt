Mental health!!!!
Mental health is the level of psychological well-being or an absence of mental illness. It is the state of someone who is "functioning at a satisfactory level of emotional and behavioral adjustment".[1] From the perspectives of positive psychology or of holism, mental health may include an individual's ability to enjoy life and to create a balance between life activities and efforts to achieve psychological resilience.[2] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health includes "subjective well-being, perceived self-efficacy, autonomy, competence, inter-generational dependence, and self-actualization of one's intellectual and emotional potential, among others".[3] The WHO further states that the well-being of an individual is encompassed in the realization of their abilities, coping with normal stresses of life, productive work, and contribution to their community.[4] Cultural differences, subjective assessments, and competing professional theories all affect how one defines "mental health"

The Mental Healthcare Act 2017 aims to provide mental healthcare services for persons with mental illness. It ensures that these persons have a right to live life with dignity by not being discriminated against or harassed
